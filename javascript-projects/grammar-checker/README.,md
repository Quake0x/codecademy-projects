# Grammar Checker Project

Welcome to the Grammar Checker project! This project is part of the Codecademy course **[Learn JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)**, where I developed a program to improve the quality of a paragraph by analyzing and editing the text.

## Project Overview

In this project, I applied my JavaScript knowledge to create a program that counts the number of words in a paragraph, filters out unnecessary words, corrects misspellings, and replaces inappropriate language. The program illustrates how to manipulate strings and arrays effectively to enhance text quality.

### Key Features

1. **Paragraph Initialization**: The program begins with a variable `story` that holds the initial paragraph to be edited.

2. **Word Splitting**:
   - **Array Conversion**: The `story` string is converted into an array of words using the `.split()` method.
   - The resulting `storyWords` array allows for further manipulation throughout the project.

3. **Counting Words**: 
   - A variable named `count` is initialized to store the word count.
   - The program uses the `.forEach()` method to iterate over the `storyWords` array, incrementing the `count` variable to determine the total number of words in the story.

4. **Filtering Unnecessary Words**: 
   - The program filters out the word "literally" from the `storyWords` array to shorten the text.

5. **Correcting Misspellings**:
   - The program uses the `.map()` method to correct the misspelled word "beautifull" to "beautiful."

6. **Replacing Inappropriate Language**: 
   - The program identifies and replaces the "bad" word "freaking" with "really."

7. **Length Check**: 
   - The program ensures every word in the story is 10 characters or less using the `.every()` method.

8. **Final Edits**: 
   - The program makes additional edits to ensure clarity and accessibility.

### How to Run the Project

To run the Grammar Checker project:

1. **Copy the Code**: Copy the JavaScript code provided in this project.
2. **Use a JavaScript Environment**: Open your preferred JavaScript environment, such as a web browser console or a code editor with a built-in terminal.
3. **Paste the Code**: Paste the copied code into the console or your JavaScript file.
4. **Modify the `story` Variable**: Change the `story` variable to represent your own paragraph.
5. **Execute the Code**: Press Enter to run the code in the console or run the script if you're using a code editor.

### Learning Objectives

- **Understanding Array Methods**: This project helped me learn how to utilize various array methods like `.forEach()`, `.filter()`, and `.map()`.
- **Performing Text Manipulation**: I gained practical experience in manipulating strings and arrays to edit text effectively.
- **Improving Code Readability**: Implementing these methods enhanced my understanding of writing cleaner and more efficient JavaScript code.
