# JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my JavaScript Projects repository! This repository contains the projects I completed as part of the Codecademy course **[Learn JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)**. Each project demonstrates my understanding of JavaScript concepts and best practices, especially as they relate to web development and security.

## Projects Overview

This repository includes the following projects:

1. **[Kelvin Weather](./kelvin-weather)**
   - A program that converts a fixed Kelvin temperature into Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Newton, demonstrating the use of variables, arithmetic operations, and the built-in Math object.

2. **[Dog Years](./dog-years)**
   - A program that calculates how old a person would be in dog years based on their human age, illustrating the different aging rates of dogs compared to humans.

3. **[Magic Eight Ball](./magic-eight-ball)**
   - A Magic Eight Ball program that responds with random fortune answers based on user questions, allowing the user to input their name and ask any question.

4. **[Race Day](./race-day)**
   - A program that assigns race numbers and start times for adult and youth runners based on age and early registration status, handling various conditions, including specific cases for runners exactly 18 years old.

5. **[Rock Paper or Scissors](./rock-paper-or-scissors)**
   - An interactive program that allows the user to play Rock, Paper, or Scissors against the computer, generating a choice for the computer and determining the winner, with a special "cheat code" for guaranteed wins.

6. **[Sleep Debt Calculator](./sleep-debt-calculator)**
   - A sleep debt calculator that tracks hours of sleep over a week and compares it to an ideal sleep goal, calculating whether the user has met, exceeded, or fallen short of their weekly target.

7. **[Training Days](./training-days)**
   - A program that randomly selects an event (Marathon, Triathlon, or Pentathlon) for an athlete and calculates the number of days left to train, focusing on variable scope improvements for maintainability.

8. **[Secret Message](./secret-message)**
   - A program that manipulates an array to create a secret message, demonstrating the use of various array methods like `.pop()`, `.push()`, `.shift()`, `.unshift()`, `.splice()`, and `.join()`.

9. **[Whale Talk](./whale-talk)**
   - A program that translates a phrase into "whale talk," retaining only vowels and doubling the vowels 'e' and 'u' to mimic how whales elongate these sounds in their speech.

10. **[Grammar Checker](./grammar-checker)**
    - A program that counts the number of words in a paragraph, filters out unnecessary words, corrects misspellings, and replaces inappropriate language, showcasing effective string and array manipulation.

11. **[Meal Maker](./meal-maker)**
    - An object that safely handles the meal and price for Todayâ€™s Special, ensuring type checks to prevent errors, with setter methods for valid data and a getter method that returns a formatted string.

12. **[Team Stats](./team-stats)**
    - A data structure that holds information about players and games for a sports team, utilizing factory functions to generate player and game objects for easy management and retrieval of statistics.

## Why I Learned JavaScript

As a bug bounty hunter and security researcher, learning JavaScript is essential for several reasons:

- **Understanding Client-Side Logic:** JavaScript is a core technology for building interactive web applications. A solid grasp of JavaScript allows me to understand client-side logic and how it can be manipulated, which is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities.

- **Exploiting JavaScript Vulnerabilities:** Many security vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), directly involve JavaScript. Knowing how to navigate and manipulate JavaScript helps me identify and exploit these vulnerabilities during security assessments.

- **Testing Security Controls:** As part of my role, I often test web applications for their security controls. Understanding JavaScript enables me to simulate attacks effectively and assess how well an application defends against various threats.

- **Enhancing Payload Crafting:** Proficient knowledge of JavaScript helps me create more sophisticated payloads for testing vulnerabilities. By understanding how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS, I can design targeted attacks that better mimic real-world scenarios.

- **Web Standards and Best Practices:** Learning JavaScript has introduced me to modern web standards and best practices, enabling me to develop secure, efficient, and accessible applications. This knowledge is vital for both ethical hacking and web development.
