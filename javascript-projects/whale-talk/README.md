# Whale Talk Project

Welcome to the Whale Talk project! This project is part of the Codecademy course **[Learn JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)**, where I developed a program that translates phrases into whale language by extracting vowels and elongating certain ones.

## Project Overview

In this project, I applied JavaScript to create a program that translates a phrase into "whale talk." This translation only retains vowels and doubles the vowels 'e' and 'u' to match how whales elongate these sounds in their speech.

### Key Features

1. **Vowel Extraction**: The program filters out consonants and only keeps the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' from the given input.
   
2. **Doubling Certain Vowels**:
   - The vowels 'e' and 'u' are doubled, representing the long sounds whales make when communicating.

3. **String Manipulation**: The program combines the selected vowels into a single string and converts the result to uppercase.

4. **Console Output**: The result is printed in the console, representing the whale's translated "speech."

### How to Run the Project

To run the Whale Talk project:

1. **Copy the Code**: Copy the JavaScript code provided in this project.
2. **Use a JavaScript Environment**: Open your preferred JavaScript environment, such as a web browser console or a code editor with a built-in terminal.
3. **Paste the Code**: Paste the copied code into the console or your JavaScript file.
4. **Modify the `input` Variable**: Change the `input` variable to the phrase you want to translate into whale talk.
5. **Execute the Code**: Press Enter to run the code in the console or run the script if you're using a code editor.

### Learning Objectives

- **Understanding Loops**: This project helped me practice both `for` loops and nested loops in JavaScript.
- **Array Methods**: I utilized array methods like `.push()` and `.join()` to store and manipulate the vowels.
- **String Manipulation**: Implementing string methods helped me learn how to work with strings and arrays in JavaScript.
