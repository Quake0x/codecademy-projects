## Why I Learned HTML

As a bug bounty hunter and security researcher, learning HTML is crucial for several reasons:

- **Understanding Web Applications:** A strong foundation in HTML allows me to comprehend how web applications are structured. This understanding is essential when identifying vulnerabilities and assessing security risks in web applications.

- **Identifying Security Flaws:** Many web vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and injection attacks, can be exploited by manipulating HTML and JavaScript. Knowing how HTML works helps me to identify potential weaknesses in a website's structure.

- **Creating and Testing Payloads:** As a security researcher, I often create payloads to test for vulnerabilities. Understanding the underlying HTML allows me to craft more effective and targeted payloads during security assessments.

- **Web Standards and Best Practices:** Learning HTML has introduced me to web standards and best practices, enabling me to develop secure and accessible web applications. This knowledge is vital for both ethical hacking and web development.
