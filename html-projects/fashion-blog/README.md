# Fashion Blog Project

Welcome to the Fashion Blog project! This project is part of the Codecademy course **[Learn HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)**, where I created a simple blog layout for a budding fashion blogger named Isa, just in time for New York Fashion Week.

## Project Overview

In this project, I utilized my newly acquired HTML knowledge to build the underlying structure of a fashion blog. The blog includes various HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and lists, making it visually appealing and informative for readers.

### Key Features

1. **HTML Structure**: The project starts with a proper HTML document structure, including the `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.

2. **Title and Headings**: The blog features a title "Everyday with Isa" and several headings to organize content effectively, including:
   - An H1 heading: “An Insider’s Guide to NYFW”
   - Two H2 headings: “Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows” and “Dressing for the Shows”

3. **Blog Content**: 
   - The first blog post provides insights about attending New York Fashion Week, featuring engaging text that offers tips and advice.
   - Relevant images are included above each paragraph to enhance the visual experience.

4. **Related Content**: An unordered list of related blog posts is presented to keep readers engaged and encourage further exploration of the blog.

5. **Contact Information**: A dedicated section at the bottom of the blog provides Isa's contact details, making it easy for readers to get in touch.

6. **Interactive Links**: The blog includes links that open in new tabs, enhancing user experience and accessibility.

### Learning Objectives

- **Understanding HTML Elements**: This project helped me apply various HTML elements learned in the course, such as images, links, lists, and divs.
- **Creating a Functional Layout**: I gained practical experience in structuring content on a webpage to make it user-friendly and visually appealing.
- **Improving Readability and Organization**: Using headings and lists effectively organized information, making it easier for readers to follow along.
