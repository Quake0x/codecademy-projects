# Wine Festival Schedule Project

Welcome to the Wine Festival Schedule project! This project is part of the Codecademy course **[Learn HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)**, where I built a web page to display the event schedule for the Aguillar Family's annual wine festival.

## Project Overview

In this project, I utilized my HTML skills to create a structured table that presents the schedule of events for a fictional wine festival. This project emphasizes the importance of organizing information effectively using HTML tables.

### Key Features

1. **Table Structure**: The project begins with the creation of a `<table>` element to hold the event schedule, ensuring the information is clearly laid out for attendees.

2. **Table Headings**:
   - A `<thead>` section is created with a main title "Wine Festival Schedule" that spans across two columns, making it prominent.
   - The headings "Time" and "Event" are clearly defined for easy understanding.

3. **Event Schedule**:
   - A `<tbody>` section contains five rows of events.
   - Each row includes two cells: one for the time of the event and another for the name of the event.
   - Event times are displayed in the first column, while corresponding event names are in the second column.

### Event Schedule

| Time      | Event                   |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| 12:00 PM  | Welcome Reception        |
| 01:00 PM  | Storytelling & Tasting   |
| 02:00 PM  | Wine Luncheon           |
| 03:00 PM  | Aguillar Family Wines    |
| 04:00 PM  | Wine & Cheese Tasting    |

### Learning Objectives

- **Mastering HTML Tables**: This project helped me understand how to effectively use HTML tables to organize data, which is essential for presenting structured information on web pages.
- **Improving Visual Layout**: Creating a clean and organized table layout improves user experience, making it easier for users to digest information.
