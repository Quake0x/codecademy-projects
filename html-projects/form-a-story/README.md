# Form a Story Project

Welcome to the Form a Story project! This project is part of the Codecademy course **[Learn HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)**, where I built the HTML structure of a form to collect user inputs for creating a collaborative story.

You can view the completed project [here](https://quake0x.github.io/codecademy-projects/html-projects/form-a-story).

## Project Overview

In this project, I created a form that allows users to fill in various fields, which will then be used to craft a fun story. This project showcases the power of HTML forms in gathering user input creatively.

### Key Features

1. **Form Structure**: The project begins with the creation of a `<form>` element, which collects user inputs necessary for generating a story.

2. **Input Fields**:
   - Various `<input>` fields are included for collecting different types of information, such as text, numbers, and choices (radio buttons, dropdown lists).
   - Each input is accompanied by a `<label>` to enhance user experience by clearly indicating what information is required.

3. **Field Types**: 
   - Text inputs for animals, adjectives, and verbs.
   - Number input for numerical data.
   - Radio buttons for binary choices (yes or no).
   - A dropdown list for speed options.
   - A `<datalist>` for motivational quotes, allowing users to select from predefined options or input their own.
   - A `<textarea>` for users to enter a meaningful message.

4. **Submit Button**: A submit button is provided to allow users to submit their responses, which are then processed to create a story on a separate page.

### Form Elements

The following input fields are included in the form:

- **Animal**: `Text input`
- **Another Animal**: `Text input`
- **One More Animal**: `Text input`
- **Adjective (ends in -ed)**: `Text input`
- **Verb (ends in -ing)**: `Text input`
- **Number**: `Number input`
- **Yes or No**: `Radio buttons`
- **Relative speed (ends in -er)**: `Dropdown list`
- **Motivational Quote**: `Text input with datalist`
- **Meaningful Message**: `Textarea`

### Learning Objectives

- **Understanding HTML Forms**: This project helped me learn how to effectively use forms in HTML to collect user data for interactive web applications.
- **Enhancing User Experience**: By using appropriate field types and labels, I was able to improve the overall usability of the form.
