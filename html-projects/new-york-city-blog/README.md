# New York City Blog Project

Welcome to the New York City Blog project! This project is part of the Codecademy course **[Learn HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)**, where I built a blog showcasing the amazing aspects of New York City using semantic HTML.

## Project Overview

In this project, I created a blog to provide viewers with insights into New York City, its attractions, food, and media. This project emphasizes the use of semantic HTML elements to improve the structure and accessibility of the webpage.

### Key Features

1. **Navigation Bar**: 
   - A `<nav>` element with an unordered list provides shortcuts to different sections of the blog, making it easy for users to navigate to the desired content.

2. **Main Content**:
   - The blog features a `<header>` with the main title and a `<main>` section that includes a `<section>` for the blog content and an `<article>` for detailed information about NYC.

3. **Media Elements**:
   - Enhanced visual representation of New York City through various media elements:
     - An image of the Statue of Liberty with a caption.
     - A video showcasing the NYC skyline.
     - An embedded image of the skyline.
     - An audio clip capturing the sounds of the city.

4. **Aside Content**:
   - An `<aside>` element provides additional information about NYC's food scene, including a list of popular food items in an ordered list.

5. **Footer**:
   - A `<footer>` element credits the author and provides contact information for inquiries.

### Blog Structure

The following elements are included in the blog:

- **Navigation Bar**: Links to Blog, Media, and About sections.
- **Header**: `<h1>` element with the title "New York City".
- **Main Section**: 
  - `<section id="blog">`: Contains an `<article>` with a description of New York City.

- **Media Section**: 
  - Includes a video of the NYC skyline, an embedded image, and an audio clip of city sounds.
- **Footer**: 
  - Contains author credit and contact information.
